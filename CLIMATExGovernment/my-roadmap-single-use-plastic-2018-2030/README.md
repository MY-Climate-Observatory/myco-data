# Malaysia's Roadmap towards Zero Single-Use Plastic 2018-2030

The Malaysia's Roadmap towards Zero Single-Use Plastic 2018-2030 ("Roadmap") is designed "to take a phased, evidence-based and holistic approach by involving all stakeholders
in jointly addressing single-use plastics pollution in Malaysia."
According to its publishing entity, Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment & Climate Change (MESTECC), the Roadmap "is envisaged to deploy actions 
that can deflect the current trajectory to a more sustainable pathway towards a cleaner and healthier environment by 2030."

This Roadmap will be implemented from 2018 leading up to 2030, assuming that all relevant stakeholders will play their roles effectively to support the objectives of this Roadmap.

Update *22 Sep 2020* : We are currently exploring text-as-data methodology commonly performed in comparative policy analysis.

## Data Format 
In progress.

## Meta Data

### Purpose

Conduct textual analysis on our national environmental policies to identify the actors within the policy implementation process, specifically "what was done to whom." However, such a goal has to be supported with more data. For now, we will be focusing on the preprocessing of the data into suitable corpus.
### Time Period of Creation

This dataset is cleaned and organized from July 2020 - Present.
