* `In Progress` Malaysia National Policy on the Environment 2002
*  Malaysia Roadmap towards Zero Single-Use Plastic 2018-2030

Update *23 Oct 2020* : We are currently exploring text-as-data methodology commonly performed in comparative policy analysis. As the data for a single policy is insufficient for a full analysis, each policy document is cleaned with the goal of accumulating multiple policy papers in mind. Our current analysis only serves as exploratory efforts to establish the methodology that we could possibly apply to other documents.

Update *2 Nov 2020* : We are currently looking at processing bilingual text using Sklearn. We hope that our work will be useful in future bilingual policy document processing.
