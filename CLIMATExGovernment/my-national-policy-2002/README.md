# Malaysia National Policy on the Environment 2002

The National Policy on the Environment (DASN) is developed under the portfolio of the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment in 2002. 
It has been established to promote 
environmentally sound and sustainable development to improve the quality of life of Malaysians. As stated on Official Portal of Department of Environment (DOE), 
the objectives of DASN are to achieve; 

1. A clean environment, safe, healthy and productive environment for present and future generations, 
2. Conservation of country’s unique and diverse cultural and natural heritage with effective participation by all sectors of society, and 
3. Sustainable lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production.

DOE has highlighted eight principles of the policy that attempts to harmonise economic development goals with environmental imperatives:

* Stewardship of the Environment
* Conservation of Nature’s Vitality and Diversity
* Continuous Improvement in the Quality of the Environment
* Sustainable Use of Natural Resources
* Integrated Decision-Making
* Role of the Private Sector
* Commitment and Accountability
* Active Participation in the International Community

In general, DASN seeks to "integrate environmental considerations into development activities and in all related decision-making processes, 
to foster long-term economic growth and human development, and to protect and enhance the environment." It also acts as an overarching guide that 
" complements and enhances the environmental dimensions of other national policies, such as those on forestry and industry, 
and takes cognizance of international conventions on global concerns." 

Considering that this policy statement is currently hosted on the Official Portal of Department of Environment, we are assuming that the overall environmental strategy of the country
remains similar and is still applicable until this day. Our conclusion on whether or not this is the case will be shared as we complete our analysis.
