## The Process

As of now, MYCO is operating on a manual Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process, whereby all data are processed in batches in different intervals. When contributors joins us, they will be going through the following process:

1. Define the research question and identify the climate metric
2. Locate the source
3. Extract the data
4. Clean and organize the data
5. Upload the data
6. Analyse the data
