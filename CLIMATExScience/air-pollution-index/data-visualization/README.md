# Data Visualization

We will be sharing the code for each graph in this folder. Our visualization is mainly built on `Plotly`, and the interactive dashboard is developed using `Dash`.

Current available visuals:

* Single Area API Time Series Display
* Single State, Multiple Areas API Time Series Comparison
* Frequency of Detected Pollutants
